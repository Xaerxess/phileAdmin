phileAdmin
==========

a take on an admin panel for PhileCMS

## Installing

Install like a normal Phile plugin, then go to the URL, `admin/login` and you will be redirected to the main page.

## Warning

<p style="color: red">This is a beta. There are features that do not work.</p>

### Beta Users

I am formally inviting these people to evaluate this plugin. Even if you weren't formally invited, please give it a run.

### Features

Features that work (mostly)

* edit/save pages
* media uploads
* settings save and load (works visually and writes a json)

Features that don't work

* create page (this can be done the normal way via adding a .md to the content folder)
* add children
* rename/delete page (delete works visually)
* new/save settings

### Issues

I am not really looking for issues. Since this is quite beta. I am looking for feedback into what might need to change in order for this to work.

I am still torn on wether Phile should have this type of admin interface.
